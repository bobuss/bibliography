<h2> Abstract</h2>
We present a system that enables a blind user  to access 2D WEB
based "graphical" documents. After introducing the SVG format
and the Force Feedback Mouse, we present how, in a WEB browser
application, we associate force, voice and sound feedback.


Our approach is applied with two kinds of graphical information:
geographical and musical information. In both application, after a
training phase of the mouse handling, the user can make his own
mental construction of displayed data. When the user knows the
relative position of different elements, he can move the mouse
pointer towards the region he wants.

 <h2><a name="tth_sEc1">
1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h2>


In a classical situation, a blind user uses to handle a keyboard
to operate a computer. The machine answers him by a voice
synthesis and/or a braille display. The text reading is adapted to
these methods. When browsing the WEB, a blind user will have
accessibility problems with graphical documents. The W3C has
proposed guidelines [<a href="#wai" name="CITEwai">1</a>] for web authors to design their WEB
sites. For instance, graphical data have to be linked with a
textual description. So, a graphic document may be presented to
him by long and tiresome descriptions, when they are available.


The force feedback devices are used within the context of the
accessibility for the blind users because they enable a more
direct interaction based on sensory capacities.


Many works [<a href="#omodhrain" name="CITEomodhrain">2</a>] [<a href="#offen" name="CITEoffen">3</a>] [<a href="#wies" name="CITEwies">4</a>]
[<a href="#colwell98use" name="CITEcolwell98use">5</a>] [<a href="#ramstein96" name="CITEramstein96">6</a>] [<a href="#mag:2002" name="CITEmag:2002">7</a>] aim at using
a force feedback device to make a haptic feedback to the visual
elements displayed on the screen.  For example, passing of the
pointer of the force feedback mouse on an icon will cause a small
jolt in the user hand. Moreover, Dufresne showed the interest of
the audio-haptic bimodality for blind users [<a href="#dufresne" name="CITEdufresne">8</a>].


We will first set the main definitions of the haptic perception.
We propose a specific context of use for these devices: relative
localization. We will show some technical precisions about our
system. Then we will present two prototypes that enable blind
people to access geographical and musical documents in a web
context. Lastly, we will conclude by presenting the outlooks which
we consider.


 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions of Haptic Context : Relative Localization</h2>


The tactilo-kinesthetic or " haptic" [<a href="#revesz" name="CITErevesz">9</a>] system is
the synthesis of the movements of exploration of the motor system
and of perceptions of the tactile system. The haptic sense is thus
both effector and receptor. It consists of :



<ol type="1">
<li> the cutaneous sense: it is the touch sense. It allows
to feel the temperature, the pressure or the pain, and is relayed
by sensory receptors located under the skin.

</li>

<li> the kinesthetic sense: it is the sense related on the
position and the movements of the body. It enables us for example
to know the weight of an object we're handling and its position.
It is relayed by receptors based in the muscles, the tendons and
the articulations.

</li>
</ol>


The handling of force feedback pointing devices as a mouse is
based on the kinesthetic perception of the arm. This perception
enables us to visualize the position of the hand in space. Thus,
if an haptic event, like a vibration or a shock, occurs during a
move of the arm, we can mentally represent the position that the
hand had when the event occurred.


Associated with a voice or sound synthesis, and thanks to the
sensory memory, this approach will allow the rebuilding of a
mental image of an object from the relative positions of the
elements of this object.


The two applications which we will present are founded on this
context.


 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3">
3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical Aspects</h2>


     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.1">
3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;SVG Format</h3>


We use the SVG format (Scalable Vector Graphic [<a href="#svg" name="CITEsvg">10</a>]), which
is an application of  XML (eXtended Markup Language). A SVG file
is coded in marked-up plain text and is read by the client
computer as a text file. Indeed, its contents can be indexed by
search engines and it can be generated. Moreover, SVG supports the
DOM (Document Object Model) and can react to the user events via a
script programming. SVG files can be displayed on an Internet
browser with the plugin from Adobe [<a href="#adobesvg" name="CITEadobesvg">11</a>].


In our applications, the graphical elements are defined explicitly
in SVG file as lists of coordinates. It is a real advantage
compared to the image bitmap formats.


Thanks to its features, the SVG format is yet used in an
accessibility context [<a href="#gardner" name="CITEgardner">12</a>] [<a href="#campin" name="CITEcampin">13</a>].


     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.2">
3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wingman Forces Feedback Mouse </h3>


This force feedback mouse (figure <a href="#fig:mouse">1</a>), was created by
Immersion Corporation [<a href="#immersion:devices" name="CITEimmersion:devices">14</a>] and marketed by
Logitech.


The mouse is interdependent of its base. The effective surface of
work is of 1.9 X 2.5 cm and the forces can reach 1N in peak. The
Wingman formerly was a game device, but its use
was diverted toward research on the accessibility [<a href="#omodhrain" name="CITEomodhrain">2</a>]
[<a href="#wies" name="CITEwies">4</a>] [<a href="#offen" name="CITEoffen">3</a>] [<a href="#gardner" name="CITEgardner">12</a>] [<a href="#campin" name="CITEcampin">13</a>].

      </div>
    </div>



Immersion Corporation proposes a plugin for the Internet
navigators, which gives the possibility to control a force
feedback device, via the script programming contained in a HTML
page [<a href="#immersion:plugin" name="CITEimmersion:plugin">15</a>].


     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.3">
3.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Architecture of our Applications</h3>


In a WEB context, the architecture we use is a Client-Server
Scheme on a Local Area Network (Figure <a href="#fig:archi">2</a>).

      </center>
      <div>
    <span>Figure 2: System architecture</span>
      </div>
    </div>



On the server side, we have the SVG files and the sound files. By
now, the SVG files are stored on the server or generated on the
client via an ECMAScript programming. We plan to generate all SVG
files on the server via perl programming language, accessing to
databases. For the sound files, in this first prototype, we use a
speech and  sound synthesis on the server to generate them. That
may avoid any conflict. Indeed, in a general case, a blind user
use his own screen reader and his own speech synthesis.


The client browser must have downloaded from the server the
different plugins that enable our system to work : the "Immersion
Web Plugin" [<a href="#immersion:plugin" name="CITEimmersion:plugin">15</a>] for the force feedback and
the "Adobe SVG Viewer Plugin" [<a href="#adobesvg" name="CITEadobesvg">11</a>] in order to
display the SVG files.


 <h2><a name="tth_sEc4">
4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Description of the Geographical Application</h2>
In our application (figure <a href="#fig:geo">3</a>), a map is displaying the
USA, showing the states. A blind user uses the
 force feedback mouse to explore the surface of the screen. The mouse can have
 two different behaviors. When the pointer of the mouse:

<ol type="1">
<li> goes out of the map area, the user feels a texture effect in his hand.

</li>

<li> pass on a region, it is "magnetized" towards its center.

</li>
</ol>


A sound feedback gives the name of the state, via a screen reader and a voice synthesis.
Now, when the user has his mouse pointer toward a region, he has to force to quit the state
and either

<ol type="1">
<li> falls into a region bordering.

</li>

<li> leaves the map, and then feels an effect of texture

</li>
</ol>

    <a name="tth_fIg3">
    </a>

      </center>
      <div>
    <span>Figure 3: Geographical Application</span>
      </div>
    </div>



The study of geography is well adapted to the use of the mouse, as
it may require a transfer of information from the computer to the
user, via the mouse. With HTML tags and bitmap pictures, the blind
user could only "reach" the links name through the screen reader
with no logical order, with the TAB key. Using a force feedback
mouse enables them to apprehend the layout of the links, and thus
the layout of the regions.


 <h2><a name="tth_sEc5">
5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Description of the Musical Application</h2>


In order to use the same approach in music, we needed a spatial
view of musical data. Jean Marc Chouvel has showed a torus-shaped
hexagonal representation of a musical score [<a href="#chouvel" name="CITEchouvel">16</a>]. This
representation provides some nice harmonic characteristics.


     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.1">
5.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hexagonal Representation of Musical Data</h3>


It is a instantaneous representation of the score. Notes are
showed independently from eighth interval. They are displayed on
an hexagonal lattice, showing on figure <a href="#fig:hexagone">4</a>. It is
also a torus representation : it loops horizontally and
vertically.




<a name="tth_fIg4">
</a>
 <div class="figure">
      <a name="fig:hexagone">
      </a>
      <center>
    <img src="./gamme.png" alt="Figure 4: Hexagonal Representation" width='400' height='362'>
      </center>
      <div>
    <span>Figure 4: Hexagonal Representation</span>
      </div>
    </div>



Main features of this representation are described in
[<a href="#Mathieu02a" name="CITEMathieu02a">17</a>] :



<ol type="1">
<li> Vertical axis is made by major thirds. The cycle is long of 3.

</li>

<li> Axis from the left bottom to the right top is made by minor thirds. It is 4 cells long cycle.

</li>

<li> Last axis (from the right bottom to the left top) is made by fifths. This axis has got every notes and its long is 12.

</li>

<li> From a note, its neighbors in the representation are notes with a strong harmonic
  relationship (third or fifth)

</li>

<li> close chromatic notes (half tone and tone) are separate by one line between 2
  hexagons.

</li>

<li> when two shapes are identical, it is the same chord.

</li>
</ol>


     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.2">
5.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation</h3>


In our prototype, we use the hexagonal representation in order to
present the different chords to the user.


We have implemented the simplest chords : major, minor, augmented
and diminished fifth, dominated, major, minor and diminished
seventh. Thanks to the hexagonal representation, each chord has
got a specific shape (Figure <a href="#fig:accords">5</a>).




<a name="tth_fIg5">

 <div class="figure">
      <a name="fig:accords">
      </a>
      <center>
    <img src="./accords.png" alt="Figure 5: Simple chords" width='400' height='434'>
      </center>
      <div>
    <span>Figure 5: Simple chords</span>
      </div>
    </div>



     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.3">
5.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Haptic Feedback and Usability</h3>


When using our prototype, a blind user is able to explore the
hexagonal draughtboard. Each note is materialized via the mouse by
magnetizing the cursor on the center of the hexagon, while a sound
synthesis play the note. In any moment, the user can build one of
the chord available by pressing a key.


Once a chord created, haptic feedback changes. Then, user can
recognize the specific shape of the chord.


 <h2><a name="tth_sEc6">
6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion and Outlooks</h2>
In our approach, the layout of graphic elements is displayed
thanks to a force and sound feedback. This enables blind users to
access graphical information.


We plan to prepare a test protocol, to estimate how our
applications can really improve the ability for blind users to
access geographical or musical documents. However, for the
geographical experience we have already tested our system with two
blind users, and they admit that our system enables them to create
a mental representation of a geographical map; that is very useful
in a pedagogic situation.


For the musical application, we are about to extend the usability
of our prototype. By now, only an explorative mode is available.
Next, we plan to add a listening mode, in order to access and
analyze harmonic scheme in a music. We will add also an editing
mode. Some features of the hexagonal representation hadn't been
used, such as spatial animation of cadences (an authentic cadence
is a translation of a triangle by one cell).


Finally, we are working on a more general approach of our
architecture. We are developing a software framework to create
easier any haptic-SVG WEB applications. And we are still testing
other speech and sound synthesis and SVG generation scripting
methods.
