    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This article present a survey about a point-and-click task. This
    task was done with a force feedback mouse. Compared with a point-and-click
    task without force feedback,  we have not observed a significant
    reduction of the performance when the target got a force
    feedback. However, when some other force fields are between the target
    and the movement origin, (haptic desktop for instance), performances
    decrease about 23,6%. We propose a dynamic force feedback, where
    the force intensity decreases when the mouse speed raises up. Performances
    are again worse than without force feedback, but only about 15,6%.</p>

    <h2><a name="tth_sEc1"></a>Introduction</h2>

    <p>With the graphical user interfaces (GUI) and the mouse, the
    point-and-click task is a very frequent gesture when a computer is
    used. The developpement of force feedback devices for the desktop computers aroused the
    interest of the researchers in Human Computer Interaction. Indeed, the
    performances of the force feedback devices in the fields for
    which they were conceived (telerobotics and physical simulation)
    promised clear improvements.</p>

    <p>After having set the specific terminology for the force feedback
    interaction, we will review, the various forms
    which the force feedback could take, from
    telerobotics to haptic computer desktops. In a synthesis
    of the previous works treating of the performances of a point-and-click
    task, we will see that
    the case where several potential targets disturbs the gesture, was
    very few studied. Our test protocol, aiming at studying this case,
    is then detailed, and its results are discussed. We finish by presenting
    the future directions that this study opens for our researches.</p>


    <h2><a name="tth_sEc2"></a>HAPTIC PERCEPTION</h2>

    <p>The tactilo-kinesthesic or
    "haptic"&nbsp;[<a href="#revesz" name="CITErevesz">11</a>] system consists of&nbsp;:</p>

    <ul>
      <li> the cutaneous sense&nbsp;: it is the touch sense. It allows
    to feel the temperature, the pressure
    or the pain, and is relayed by sensory receptors located under
    the skin.
      </li>

      <li> the kinesthetic sense&nbsp;: it is the sense related on the
    position and the movements of the body. It enables us for example to
    know the weight of an object we're handling and its position. It
    is relayed by receptors based in the muscles, the tendons and the
    articulations&nbsp;[<a href="#Burdea1996" name="CITEBurdea1996">2</a>].
      </li>
    </ul>


    <p>We can add to these definitions the proprioceptive perception
    (often included in kinesthetic perception). Proprioceptive perception
    makes it possible to know the configuration of our body in space.</p>

    <h2><a name="tth_sEc3"></a>Haptic Feedback Performance in a Point and Click Task</h2>

    <p>Hapic feedback is used with an aim of improving the human motor
    performances in the virtual and telerobotics
    environments&nbsp;[<a href="#Rosenberg1994" name="CITERosenberg1994">12</a>,<a href="#Sheridan1992" name="CITESheridan1992">13</a>]. The quantitative tools
    with which we can evaluate the performances in a point-and-clic task
    are based on research of Fitts&nbsp;[<a href="#Fitts:54" name="CITEFitts:54">6</a>].</p>


    <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.1"></a>Fitts'Law</h3>

    <p>The movement time (MT) necessary to select a target of
    size W located at a distance A is&nbsp;: </p>
    <a name="mackenzie">
    </a>


    <table border="0" width="100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <table align="center" cellspacing="0"  cellpadding="2">
        <tr>
          <td nowrap="nowrap" align="center">
            MT = a + blog<sub>2</sub>(A/W +1)
          </td>
        </tr>
        </table>
      </td>
      <td width="1%">(1)
      </td>
    </tr>
    </table>


    <p>where a, b are empirically determined
    constants. The logarithm log<sub>2</sub>(A/W) represents
    the index of difficulty (ID) of the task and is expressed out of
    bits. Higher is the value of ID and more difficult is the task.
    If MT is expressed in second, the constant a will be
    expressed in second and b in seconde/bit. 1/b is the index of performance
    (IP) and is expressed in bit/seconde. </p>


    <p>Let us note that the equation&nbsp;(<a href="#mackenzie">1</a>) is called the
      Shannon's formulation of the Fitts'law and was proposed by
      MacKenzie in 1992 (see&nbsp;[<a href="#MacKenzie92" name="CITEMacKenzie92">9</a>] for a discussion on
      the various formulations of the Fitts'law).</p>


    <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.2"></a>Previous Works</h3>

    <p>Several studies evaluated the use of haptic devices in a
      point-and-click task.</p>


    <p>In 1994, Akamatsu and MacKenzie&nbsp;[<a href="#AKAMATSU1996" name="CITEAKAMATSU1996">1</a>] studied a
      tactile and force feedback mouse. They showed significant reductions
      of the movement time MT, when the tactile method is employed.
      The effect is particularly marked for the small targets. However, they
      also noted an increase in the error rate. Moreover, the use of the
      kinesthetic method only does not make significantly lower times of target
      acquisition. Lastly, the index of performance IP is not significantly
      different from that observed without force feedback.</p>


    <p>Eberhardt [<a href="#Eberhardt1997" name="CITEEberhardt1997">5</a>] and Hasser
      [<a href="#Hasser1998" name="CITEHasser1998">7</a>] studied, respectively in 1997 and 1998, the
      effects of areas of attraction around the targets. These areas bring
      the pointer of the mouse to the center of the target. In these cases,
      the performances observed are really
      better (about 25%) than without force feedback.</p>


    <p>For Wall [<a href="#Wall2000" name="CITEWall2000">14</a>], the study was focused on the index of performance
      IP  during a point-and-click, carried out with PHANToM. He found
      that the force feedback, although improving acquisition times, does
      not have effects on the index of performance IP. On the other hand,
      for the "ballistic" movements (ID  &lt;  3bits), they showed a
      significant improvement of the index of performance of the task.</p>


    <p>Lastly, Dennerlein also studied the contribution of the force
      feedback. A first study [<a href="#Dennerlein2000" name="CITEDennerlein2000">3</a>] realized in 2000, was
      about the follow-up of curves. The force feedback took the form of an
      attraction of the cursor on the curve due to a kind of haptic
      tunnel. He proved that the movements carried out with a feedback of
      force were 52% faster than without. A second study
      [<a href="#Dennerlein2001" name="CITEDennerlein2001">4</a>], realized in 2001, was about the
      movements of tagets acquisition. It was the concept of attractions area
      around the target which was retained. The results are similar with
      those of Eberhardt and Hasser&nbsp;: an improvement of 25% of the
      performances is observed with the use of the force feedback. It also
      showed that this difference was reduced when other haptic basins of
      attraction were generated. </p>


    <p>In conclusion, it appears that the force feedback tend to improve the
      performances. Acquisition time of a target improve of 25% when
      the force fields acts beyond the target; on the other hand, when
      the force is activated only with the overflight of the target,
      times are not significantly different. Moreover, in the case of
      disturbances resulting from others target potential which generate
      their own force feedback, as in the case of an office haptiquement
      increased (for example the immersion haptic desktop
      [<a href="#immersion" name="CITEimmersion">8</a>]), the performances drop. </p>

    <p>We now will study how these disturbances influence the performances,
      in the case of a force feedback restricted to the target, and with a
      workspace entirely filled of zones generating a haptic feedback.</p>


    <h2><a name="tth_sEc4"></a>TEST PROTOCOL</h2>


    <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.1"></a>Subjects</h3>
    <p>Nine subjects (8 men and
      1 woman, from 21 years old to 40 years old) participated in the experiment. All the
      subjects were familiar with the use of a mouse; two of them had
      already used a force feedback mouse.</p>


    <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.2"></a>Apparatus</h3>

    <p>We use the "Wingman
      Force Feedback Mouse" (Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:mouse">1</a>) conceived by
      Immersion Corporation [<a href="#immersion" name="CITEimmersion">8</a>] and marketed by
      Logitech.</p>

    <span>Figure 1: Wingman force feedback mouse</span>
      </div>


    </div>


    <p>The mouse itself is interdependent of its base. In fact, the working
      surface is very reduced&nbsp;: 1,9&nbsp;cm by
      2,5&nbsp;cm. Lastly, the mouse can generate forces that can reach
      1&nbsp;N.</p>


    <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.3"></a>Procedure</h3>

    <p>During the experiment, each subject must go to click on a small
      circle in the right top corner of the screen&nbsp;: the origin. Once the
      click carried out on the origin, an hexagonal target appears on
      the screen. The subject have to go to click as quickly as
      possible on this target. The subject can prepare its gesture as long
      as the cursor of the mouse does not leave the origin. When he clicked
      on the target, this one desappears and he must turn over to the origin
      in order to generate a new target.  </p>


    <p>The whole of the experiment is divided into 4 phases, corresponding to
      4 conditions of haptic feedback&nbsp;: </p>


    <ul>
      <li>MT condition&nbsp;: no force feedback.</li>
      <li>MTF condition&nbsp;: the force is activated when the
    mouse cursor overflies the target. The mouse is attracted
    in the center of the target.</li>
      <li>MTDF condition&nbsp;: the entire screen is filled by a
    mosaic of hexagons. Each hexagon activate a force when it is
    overflown by the cursor. The MTDF condition simulates the worse
    case&nbsp;: the entire screen is filled by potential targets. However, this
    represent a condition very closed to an haptic desktop with numerous
    potential targets.</li>
      <li>MTDFH condition&nbsp;: same thing that the MTDF condition,
    but the intensity of the force feedback depends on the velocity
    of the mouse, according to law
    <br clear="all" /><table border="0" width="95%"><tr><td>
        <table align="center" cellspacing="0"  cellpadding="2"><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center">
            Intensity<sub>force</sub> = </td><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center">
            Intensity<sub>max</sub>
            <div class="hrcomp"><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/></div>velocity + 1<br /></td><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center">
              </td></tr></table>
          </td></tr></table>

    the intensity will be thus weaker when the velocity of the mouse is high.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>Before each timed phase, a training phase allows the subject to be
      accustomed to handle the device under the various conditions. </p>

    <p>There are 10 different targets. Each one is presented 4 times at the
      subject by phase. Thus, each subject will have 160 movements
      origin-target to realize for a set of 1440 movements for the whole
      of the subjects.</p>

      table&nbsp;<a href="#table1">1</a> and the protocol interface is shown on the

    <h2><a name="tth_sEc5"></a>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</h2>

    <p>The analysis of variance (ANOVA) performed on the movement time enable us to
      pronounce on the significativity of the experimental factors&nbsp;: the 4
      experimental conditions and the 10 index of difficulty from our 10
      different targets. It
      appears that the factor "experimental conditions" is very significant
      (F<sub>3,39</sub>=10.3, p &lt; 0.0001), as well as the factor "index of
      difficulty" (F<sub>9,39</sub>=24.96, p &lt; 0.0001). Moreover, the two
      factors do not influence each other (F<sub>27,39</sub>=0.35,p=1,0000).</p>

    <p>The mean times for the 4 conditions of haptic feedback are shown in
      table&nbsp;<a href="#table3">2</a>.  </p>

    <span>Table 2: Mean movement times under the 4 conditions;
      the percentages give the variation relative to the MT condition</span>
      </div>

    </div>

    <p>We can already observe that there is no significant difference
      between clicking on a target without force feedback (MT) and with
      force feedback (MTF). This joined the observations of Akamatsu
      [<a href="#AKAMATSU1996" name="CITEAKAMATSU1996">1</a>] and is explained by the fact why the force
      feedback is activated only when the pointer overfly the target.
      On the other hand, the fact that there are fields of force between the
      origin and target (MTDF and MTDFH) generates a significant rise
      of times (respectively +23,6% and +15,6% compared to the
      movement without force feedback). In these cases, the pointing task is
      perturbed by the other forces. Lastly, the adaptation of the
      force feedback on the velocity of the cursor reduces
      this loss of performance about 6,5%.</p>


    <p>We could hope a better result for the MTDFH condition. However, the
      <i>optimized initial impulse</i> model [<a href="#meyer1988" name="CITEmeyer1988">10</a>] give us an
      explanation&nbsp;: the more likely cases of a point-and-clic task
      consist of a first initial movement that under or over shoots the
      target, followed by subsequent corrective movements. With our
      adaptative force, the initial movement may be kept in a wrong target.</p>


    <p>The linear regressions on the averages of the data give us the linear
      coefficients of regression of the equation&nbsp;(<a href="#mackenzie">1</a>) for
      the various conditions of haptic feedback. Thus, the table
      <a href="#table2">3</a> presents the various models of the Fitts'law
      according to these conditions.</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The various conditions differ significantly only from their
      intercepts. The slopes of each model are very close.
      Lastly, we can note, due to the high values of the R<sup>2</sup> that
      the Fitts'law explains more than 90% of the variance in observations. </p>

    <p>We can now trace the synthesis of measurements of our experiment
      (figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:test">3</a>). </p>

    <h2><a name="tth_sEc6"></a>PERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSION</h2>
    <p>For 50 years, the force feedback devices
      have been used in many fields&nbsp;: telerobotics,
      physical simulation, virtual reality, medical applications or
      accessibility. The study of the human performances at the time of the
      handling of these devices goes up with ten years, in fact when they were proposed in versions large-public.</p>


    <p>It appeared that the force feedback could improve the performances,
      but in cases not very applicable to complex situations&nbsp;: only one
      haptic enhanced target. In the case of a multiplication of
      the potential targets, the haptic feedback even becomes a factor of loss
      of performances. </p>


    <p>We proposed here an adaptive force feedback, calculated according to
      the current velocity of the pointer. The performances only degrade by
      15.6%.</p>


    <p>We envisage to test other dynamic adaptations of the forces, based on
      velocity or even acceleration. Moreover, we intend to modify the test
      protocol in order to test the significativity of the sites of the
      targets&nbsp;: which difference in performances can we observe in a
      point-and-clic task where the target and the origin are separated by
      aligned and non-aligned force fields? Due to the answer to this question, we would be
      able to get indications for the designs of widgets with haptic Enhancement.</p>
