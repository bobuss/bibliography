<h2> Abstract</h2>
    <p> In this paper, we discuss the possible uses, for a blind user, of force
      feedback pointing devices, such as the mouse Wingman Force
      Feedback Mouse and the PHANTOM,
      associated with a sound feedback. We set the definitions of the gesture
      interaction and propose the interaction loop relative to these
      devices. Related works enable us to raise the limit of their use
      and thus to specify within which framework they are adapted: the relative localization
      of elements compared to the
      others. The applications that we are developing are based on this context
      of use. We present our application of geography which indicates the relative
      positions of the areas on a map, via a
      force feedback mouse and a voice synthesis. Lastly, we present the
      prototype of our three-dimensional application which accounts for the
      relative position of the human body elements. In order to
      automate the treatment as much as possible, we based our applications
      on data files in XML: the SVG for the geographical maps and the
      X3D will be retained for the format of the forms in 3D.</p>


    <b>Keywords: </b>accessibility, force feedback pointing devices, gestural interaction


    <h2><a name="tth_sEc1">1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h2>


    In front of a computer, a blind user uses the keyboard to operate
    the machine which answers him by a voice synthesis and/or a
    braille display. The text processing is well adapted to these methods.
    However, a graphic document will be presented to him by long
    and tiresome descriptions. The force feedback devices are used
    within the framework of the accessiblity for the blind users because
    they authorize a more direct interaction based on sensory
    capacities.


    We first of all will set the main definitions of the
    gestural interaction and will locate the perceptual mechanisms
    needed in order to use these devices. We concentrate
    here more specifically on force feedack pointing devices like the
    mouse. While reviewing related works
    within the framework of the accessibility for the blind users, as well
    as the limits observed, we propose a specific context of use for these
    devices: relative localization.


    We present then two applications of the relative localization. In 2D,
    it is a programme of reading of geographical maps which allows a
    better accessibility for the blind men; and in 3D, our prototype makes
    it possible to a blind man to deduce the position from a human body model
    displayed on the screen. Lastly, we will conclude by presenting the
    outlooks which we consider.


    <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The gestural interaction</h2>


    We set the general standards which relate to the gestural interaction
    between the user and the machine. A action-reaction loop (or
    interaction loop) could then be defined in our applicative context.


    <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.1">2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Human gesture</h3>


    The tactilo-kinesthetic or " haptic" [<a href="#revesz" name="CITErevesz">Rev50</a>] system is the
    synthesis of the movements of exploration of the motor system
    and of perceptions of the tactile
    system. The haptic sense is thus both
    effector and receptor. [<a href="#lederman:haptic" name="CITElederman:haptic">LK87</a>] classified these two
    aspects in the following way:
    <ol>
      <li>movements of exploration of the hand:
        <ol>
      <li> side friction (movement on both sides of
        the surface of an object)
      <li> envelopment
      <li> the static contact (positioning of the palm of the hand
        on the surface of an object)
      <li> the following of contours
      <li> the pressure (regular force applied to a given place of
        the object)
      <li> the rising of an object
    </ol>
      <li>sensory capacities related to the gestural modality:
    <ol>
      <li> the cutaneous sense: it is the touch sense. It allows
        to feel the temperature, the pressure
        or the pain, and is relayed by sensory receptors located under
        the skin.
      <li> the kinesthetic sense: it is the sense related on the
        position and the movements of the body. It enables us for example to
        know the weight of an object we're handling and its position. It
        is relayed by receptors based in the muscles, the tendons and the
        articulations.
    </ol>
    </ol>

All these human capacities must
have their equivalent on the machine, in order to accomplish the interaction
loop. We will see further which sensory and explorative
capacities are stimulated according to the devices that we use.


     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.2">2.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer "gesture"</h3>


There are numerous force feedback and/or tactile devices.


In our study, we focused more specifically on the
force feedback pointing devices. These devices handle
only one pointer in the virtual space of the machine: the position of
the device is then translated into a couple of coordinates  (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)  in 2D or a triplet  (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>)  in 3D.


The devices are the Wingman Force Feedback Mouse for
the 2D and the PHANToM for the 3D.


    <h4><a name="tth_sEc2.2.1">2.2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wingman Forces Feedback Mouse </h4>


This force feedback mouse (figure <a href="#mouse">1</a>), was created by Immersion Corporation
and marketed by Logitech.


The mouse is interdependent of its
base. The effective surface of work is of 1.9 X 2.5 cm and the forces
can reach 1N in peak. The Wingman formely was a game
device, but its use was diverted toward research
on the accessibility.

    <h4><a name="tth_sEc2.2.2">2.2.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The PHANTOM </h4>


The PHANTOM (figure <a href="#phantom">2</a>) was created
and is marketed by Sensable Technology. It is the most popular
device in research on the haptic interaction. The volume of work
is of 13 X 16 X 13cm and the force feedback can reach 8.5N.

    </div>

  <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.2">2.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The interaction loop for the pointing</h3>


The handling of these two pointing devices makes use of
the movements of exploration of the arm. Articulations of the
shoulder, the elbow and the wrist, and their associated muscles are
thus implemented. The feedback operates on the same parts of the body.
It is thus kinesthetic perception related to the arm via the shoulder,
the elbow and the wrist which is requested.


 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3">3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Force feedback for blind users</h2>


    <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.1">3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Related Works</h3>


The use of the force feeback for blind users aims to make up,
as much as reasonably possible, for the absence of the visual
channel. Several approaches exist.



    <ol>



      <li> Haptic feedback of a graphic interface. Thanks to force feedback mice,
    [<a href="#ramstein96" name="CITEramstein96">Ram96</a>] and [<a href="#rosenberg" name="CITErosenberg">Ros97</a>] transcribed the
    the graphic interactors of the interface in force feedback.

      </li>

      <li> Haptic feedback of the contents and the layout of a document. The
    translation of mathematical figures or tables was studied by
    [<a href="#fritz96" name="CITEfritz96">FB96</a>]. [<a href="#fritz99" name="CITEfritz99">FB99</a>] finally carried out a haptic system
    of visualization based on the PHANToM for people with
    visual handicap. [<a href="#offen" name="CITEoffen">OT01</a>] developed a programming library
    making it possible to identify the layout of a document and to guide
    the hand of the user on this document.

      </li>

      <li> Description of graphic documents. [<a href="#hardwick" name="CITEhardwick">HFR98</a>] studied the
    possibilities of a force fedback on VRML (Virtual Reality Markup
    Language), a 3D file format on the Web. [<a href="#gardner" name="CITEgardner">GB01</a>] used
    the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) to enable blind users to read geographical
    maps.

      </li>

      <li> Apprehension of shapes or textures. [<a href="#fritz96" name="CITEfritz96">FB96</a>] worked
    on the synthesis of haptic textures. [<a href="#colwell98use" name="CITEcolwell98use">CPK<sup>+</sup>98</a>] used
    the Impulse Engine 3000 to study perception by the blind users of textures
    and virtual shapes. Finally [<a href="#yu01haptic" name="CITEyu01haptic">YRB01</a>] studied the
    perception of mathematical graphics by blind users using the
    PHANToM.




      </li>
    </ol>


Moreover, [<a href="#dufresne" name="CITEdufresne">DMR95</a>] showed the interest of the audio-haptic
bimodality for blind users. The table <a href="#tab1">1</a> indicates the
percentage of good answers for three modal situations for 12 sighted users
and 12 blind users.

<h3><a name="tth_sEc3.2">3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Limits</h3>


Limits were raised in the use of force feedback pointing devices
for the blind users. As follows:



    <ol>



      <li> the use of these devices for the
    perception of textures is inadequate, as pointed [<a href="#yu01haptic" name="CITEyu01haptic">YRB01</a>].
    Indeed, the cutaneous perceptors of the skin are not stimulated.

      </li>

      <li> [<a href="#magnusson" name="CITEmagnusson">MRGSD02</a>] and [<a href="#colwell98use" name="CITEcolwell98use">CPK<sup>+</sup>98</a>] pointed that the
    single contact point of the PHANToM does not allow
    the recognition of a three-dimensional complex shape. The gestures of
    envelopment of the hand would allow such a recognition, but that would
    need a device activating the kinesthesic feedback on the fingers.




      </li>
    </ol>


     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.3">3.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative localization</h3>


    The use of force feedback pointing devices must be
    based on the properties of the kinesthesic interaction of the arm.


    Kinesthesic perception related to the arm enables us to visualize the
    position of the hand in space. Thus, if an haptic event, like a
    vibration or a shock, occurs during a move of the
    arm, we can mentally represent the position that the hand had when
    the event occurred.


    Associated with a voice synthesis, this approach will allow the
    rebuilding of a mental image of an object from the relative
    positions of the elements of this object.


    The two applications which we will present use the force feedback in
    this context.


    <h2><a name="tth_sEc4">4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications of the relative localization</h2>


    <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.1">4.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;2D application: Géogr'Haptic</h3>


    In this application, which run in a Internet browser, we
    display a map indicating the American states. A blind user
    handle the Wingman Force Feedback Mouse to
    explore the surface of the screen. When the pointer of the mouse
    passes on an area, it is "magnetized" toward its center. A
    sound feedback gives the name of the state, via a screen reader
    and a voice synthesis. The figure <a href="#geo1">3</a> illustrates this
    operation.




    <div class="figure">
      <a name="geo1">
      </a>
      <center>
    <img src="./figure1.png" alt="Figure 3: Geogr'Haptic, before the move" width='400' height='250'>
      </center>
      <div>
    <span>Figure 3: Geogr'Haptic, before the move</span>
      </div>
    </div>



    It is then necessary for the user to force his way out of
    the area, and either:

    <ol>

      <li> to fall into a state bordering
    and to hear the name of this state, as the figure <a href="#geo2">4</a> shows it;

      </li>

      <li> to leave the map, and then to feel an effect of texture.


      </li>
    </ol>


    <div class="figure">
      <a name="geo2">
      </a>
      <center>
    <img src="./figure2.png" alt="Figure 4: Geogr'Haptic, after the move" width='400' height='249'>
      </center>
      <div>
    <span>Figure 4: Geogr'Haptic, after the move</span>
      </div>
    </div>





    The format of the map is the SVG [<a href="#svg" name="CITEsvg">SVG03</a>] which is the
    implementation in XML of the vectorial pictures. The interest to use
    this format is multiple:



    <ol>



      <li> its contents can
    be indexed by the search engines on the Web.

      </li>

      <li> the SVG supports the DOM (Document Object Model) and
    is therefore entirely scriptable. Geogr'Haptic is coded in
    Javascript.

      </li>

      <li> graphics in SVG can react to the users events such as
    onMouseOver() when the mouse passes on an area or onMouseClic() when
    the user clicks.

      </li>

      <li> the SVG can be displayed perfectly on all platforms, all output
    resolutions, with various bandwidths.


      </li>
    </ol>


    The first tests which we carried out with blind users are
    encouraging: they are able to quote the frontier states of Canada, or
    which states one must cross to go from a point A to a point B, which
    would not be possible by using traditional pictures on the Web.


    <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.2">4.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;3D application</h3>


    This application uses the same principle as géogr'Haptic
    but in three dimensions thanks to the use of the
    PHANToM. We plan to base the application on the
    3D XML format: the X3D [<a href="#x3d" name="CITEx3d">X3D02</a>]. However, for the
    prototype, we currently use the POSER file format
    [<a href="#poser" name="CITEposer">Cur04</a>] which contains, like the X3D, some meta-datas.
    The figure <a href="#human1">5</a> shows the prototype of the application after
    the loading of a model of a human skeleton.




    <div class="figure">
      <a name="human1">
      </a>
      <center>
    <img src="./body.png" alt="Figure 5: Body'Haptic" width='400' height='354'>
      </center>
      <div>
    <span>Figure 5: Body'Haptic</span>
      </div>
    </div>



    When we load the 3D model, the bounding boxes of each element are
    computed. A 3D cursor moved by the
    PHANToM allows to navigate into the 3D scene. A
    force feedback then attracts the pointer in the center of the
    nearest bounding box, while a voice synthesis reads the name of this
    element.


    Nowadays, our prototype allows to blind user to deduce
    the 3D model position. For instance, on the figure <a href="#human1">5</a>
    it is standing with the arms in cross.


    <h2><a name="tth_sEc5">5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Outlooks</h2>


    We should soon propose a test protocol which aims to confront our
    prototypes with the existing tools of access to the graphic
    documents for blind people.


    The prototype of our 3D application is still in an early stage
    development. For complex 3D models, our application will have
    to filter informations to be handled by the force feedback
    in instance to produce a scene with a good haptic
    legibility.


    We're going to use the XML 3D file format for the Web: the
    X3D [<a href="#x3d" name="CITEx3d">X3D02</a>]. Just like the SVG, the X3D is
    completely scriptable, and support the DOM, which enables us to
    consider an exploitation in a Internet browser. Moreover its
    specifications include the management of the objects displayed by
    pointing devices.


    We must also study adjustments of the force feedback, which would
    be specific with the 3D model loaded: an effect could thus guide
    the user hand along the elements and the effects could be
    characteristic of the various parts of the body (the intensity of the
    effect would be different if we are in a bone or in an organ).


    This leads us to our last objective: we are about to build a 3D model of a
    human body including the organs. The haptic reading of
    such a model would be useful for blind and sighted users,
    in a pedagogical context.
